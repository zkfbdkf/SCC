Find out Strongly Connected Components

This Source code is about making Strong Connected Component according to the graph G.

The graph is defined by 2-D integer matrix. 

static int[][] Link = {   
              { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },   
	            { 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0 },   
	            { 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0 },  
              { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 },   
	            { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },   
	            { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 },  
              { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 },   
	            { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 } };//Original Graph  

you should change the value for different graph links.
